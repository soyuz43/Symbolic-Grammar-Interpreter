# CONTRADICTIONS: Typologies vs Library

## 🧠 Purpose

This document defines the epistemic roles of two directories used in contradiction-based mutation and falsifiability tracking.

## 🔬 `typologies/`: Ontology of Contradiction Classes

> A **semantic taxonomy** of contradiction forms across rhetorical, logical, and systemic domains.

Each file in `typologies/` defines a **generalized contradiction type**, including:

- Name & description
- Common structural triggers
- Confidence scaling rules
- Optional semantic patterns (regex or symbolic tags)
- Example cases (optional)

### ✅ Example: `recursion-paradox.yaml`

```yaml
id: recursion-paradox
description: >
  Occurs when a system references itself in a way that bypasses its own falsification boundary.

common_triggers:
  - Self-modifying definitions
  - Infinite regressions unbounded by semantic anchors

confidence_modifiers:
  - If contradiction includes negation → +0.1
  - If tied to undefined base → +0.2

example_usage:
  artifact: tau_falsify
  line: 41
  context: "Recursive models refactor before falsifiability can trigger."
```

These definitions support:

- Classification during extraction (`extract_contradictions.sh`)
- Diagnostic interfaces
- Toolchain transparency

## 📚 `library/`: Historical Contradiction Records

> A **collection of specific contradiction logs** extracted from rhetorical artifacts or used in actual mutations.

Each `.yaml` file in this folder is:

- A **flat list** of contradiction instances
- Timestamped or named based on origin
- Referenced during `mutate_artifact.sh` or stored in `genN_<artifact>/`

### ✅ Example: `gen3_tau_falsify.yaml`

```yaml
- line: 42
  type: recursion-paradox
  description: "Recursive models refactor before falsifiability can trigger."
  confidence: 0.91

- line: 87
  type: axiom-inversion
  description: "Claims optimization is truth-seeking, but also calls it a ritual."
  confidence: 0.85
```

These are generated by:

```bash
./scripts/falsification/extract_contradictions.sh path/to/raw_artifact.md
```

And optionally passed into:

```bash
./scripts/falsification/mutate_artifact.sh tau_falsify gen2 gen3 --pressure contradictions/library/gen3_tau_falsify.yaml
```

## 🧩 When to Use Which?

| Use Case | Use `typologies/` | Use `library/` |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Build contradiction extractors | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No         |
| Curate contradiction classes   | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No         |
| Mutate artifacts under pressure| ❌ No          | ✅ Yes        |
| Validate collapse vs drift     | ✅ via pressure index | ✅ used in pressure.json |
| Train future validators         | ✅ Source schema | ✅ Training data |

---

## 🔐 Enforcement Rule (CLI)

- `extract_contradictions.sh` references `typologies/` for classification
- `mutate_artifact.sh` only accepts **library-style flat logs**, but will flatten structured YAML on-the-fly
- `check_trace_integrity.sh` can confirm that:
  - All `contradictions.yaml` used in a generation are flat
  - Their types match known entries in `typologies/`

---

## 🌱 Future Tools

- `validate_typologies.sh` — Check coherence of type definitions
- `cluster_contradiction_logs.sh` — Group contradiction logs by typology + drift vector
- `pressure_diff_viewer.sh` — Compare pressure levels across mutations
