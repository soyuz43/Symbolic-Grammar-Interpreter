You‚Äôre asking not for a static architecture, but for a **topological tension field** ‚Äî a representation of **metaphysical stress, recursion, and semiotic interaction** ‚Äî modeled via **Mermaid diagrams** across three iterations.

Each iteration will:
1. **Form the system** as a **graph of interpretive forces**
2. Identify where **epistemic tension emerges or accumulates**
3. Evaluate structural integrity, coherence flow, and points of collapse
4. Use the critique to revise and generate the next iteration

This mirrors the system you're designing: one that **doesn‚Äôt assume stability**, but builds under pressure.

Let‚Äôs begin.

## üîÅ **Iteration 1: Flat Interpretive Topology**

This version treats all components as **equal symbolic agents** in a constraint network.

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[‚àá Gradient Mapping] --> D[E Interpretive Engine]
  B[‚Ñò Powerset Generator] --> D
  C[‚¶∞ Nullifier] --> D

  D --> F[Coherence Metric]
  F --> G[Output Representation]

  H[ADE - Adversarial Dialectics] --> D
  H --> I[¬¨C Generator]
```

### üß† Meta-Abstraction 1:
- The field is **flat**: all inputs flow into a single interpretive node `D`, which is doing too much.
- There‚Äôs **no temporal recursion**, **no functional partitioning**, and **no internal dialectic loop within the field**.

### üß® Collapse 1:
- **Tension is unstructured**. Every contradiction resolves or explodes at the same site (`D`)
- No preservation of **contradiction paths**, **recursive pressure**, or **role-differentiated processing**

---

## üîÅ **Iteration 2: Layered Recursive Field (Temporal + Dialectic)**

This revision introduces **temporal recursion** and **dialectical pathways**. Coherence is now a **time-sensitive derivative**, not a static evaluation.

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph Primitive Ops
    A1[‚àá Gradient] --> ISE
    A2[‚Ñò Powerset] --> ISE
    A3[‚¶∞ Null] --> ISE
  end

  subgraph Reflexive Field
    ISE[Interpretive State Engine] --> T1[Coherence Field t‚ÇÄ]
    T1 --> T2[Coherence Field t‚ÇÅ]
    T2 --> T3[Coherence Field t‚ÇÇ]
    T3 --> Collapse{Œî Coherence > Threshold?}
  end

  subgraph Dialectical Engine
    C[Claim (C)] --> R1[¬¨C Generator]
    R1 --> ADE[Contradiction Evaluator]
    ADE --> ISE
  end

  Collapse --> Nullify[Trigger ‚¶∞ or Rewrite Rules]
```

### üß† Meta-Abstraction 2:
- **Temporal gradient of tension** is now visualized ‚Äî tension accumulates over states, not statically.
- The **ADE loop feeds back into interpretation**, allowing recursion.
- Still no **functional role segmentation** ‚Äî the whole meaning is treated homogeneously.

### üß® Collapse 2:
- **Contradiction is handled globally**; no way to say ‚Äúinterpersonal stance contradicts ideational content‚Äù
- Role confusion = pressure distortion = **semiotic noise** with no damping mechanism

---

## üîÅ **Iteration 3: Full Semiotic-Tension Field with Role Partitioning**

This version introduces **Hallidayan metafunctional roles** and their **cross-pressure effects**. Contradiction now happens **between roles**, not just within logic.

  Reweighter --> IdeationFSM
  Reweighter --> InterpersonalFSM
  Reweighter --> TextualFSM
```

---

### üß† Meta-Abstraction 3:

- **Interpretive roles now have semiotic agency**: each FSM encodes a different facet of meaning
- The system no longer collapses at a single node ‚Äî **tension is distributed, analyzable, and adaptive**
- Reflexivity isn‚Äôt symbolic ‚Äî it‚Äôs encoded in **feedback-adjusted weight dynamics**

### üß® Collapse 3 (Residual):
- If role divergence is not resolvable (e.g., sarcasm intended, but coherence engine flags contradiction), the system still collapses unless it supports **controlled incoherence** or **paradox modeling**
- No current formal layer for **symbolic pluralism** or **intentional ambiguity**

<final_answer>

‚úÖ **Mermaid Diagram Iteration 3 models the complete tension field** for your system:
- Primitive operators route into role-partitioned interpretive FSMs  
- Dialectical contradiction and temporal coherence fields allow recursion  
- Epistemic tension is defined as a measurable gradient  
- Reflexive weighting closes the loop: the system adapts, not just evaluates  

This is not just a logic tree ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **semiotic dynamic system under pressure**.

‚è∏Ô∏è Holding now.  
You may proceed to instruct generation of **Iteration 3: Final Comprehensive Construction**, or call for additional recursive decompositions of any component.
