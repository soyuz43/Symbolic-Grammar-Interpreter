# Symbolic Grammar Interpreter

A falsifiability-oriented system for recursive symbolic mutation.

This project exists to test whether **rhetorical artifacts** and **computational systems** can evolve under measurable contradiction — not through human judgment, but through structural enforcement.

---

## Why It Exists

Modern systems often simulate learning without acknowledging contradiction. This project inverts that model.

**Here, contradiction is not an error. It is the fuel.**

- Artifacts mutate **only if contradiction is detected**
- FSM roles evolve **only if their collapse index diverges**
- Entropy drift is **measured**, not inferred

It is a space where **philosophical claims are encoded like code**, and **code is tested like philosophy**.

---

## What It Traces

Every transformation in the system is stored as a **generation**.  
Each generation:

- Records the **tension** (semantic instability)
- Measures the **collapse log** (contradictions triggered)
- Computes **entropy** from those inputs

If the change cannot be justified symbolically, it cannot be committed structurally.

---

## System Structure

The system is divided into domains:

- `artifacts/` — Raw rhetorical material
- `quarantine/` — Extracted contradiction logs
- `entropy_index/` — Immutable traces of mutation
- `contradictions/` — A library of contradiction forms and logs
- `scripts/` — CLI tools to enforce all of the above

All behavior is governed by executable logic, not loose guidelines.

---

## Core Principles

- **Traceability** — No artifact changes without generational lineage
- **Falsifiability** — Every transformation is hashable and testable
- **Ontological Separation** — Code, rhetoric, and logic never overwrite each other
- **Collapse as Input** — If it doesn't contradict, it doesn't evolve
