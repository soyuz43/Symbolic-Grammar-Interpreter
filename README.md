# Symbolic Grammar Interpreter

> A recursive symbolic system for controlled evolution of structured knowledge.

---

## Why It Exists

Modern software systems drift.  
Documentation rots.  
Specifications contradict themselves.

**This project builds an infrastructure layer** to:
- Detect semantic contradictions before they metastasize
- Track evolution of knowledge as immutable, auditable traces
- Formalize change processes without enforcing rigidity

Instead of fighting drift, it **harnesses it as an input**.

---

## How It Works

Every idea, spec, or system trace passes through an enforced lifecycle:
- Proposed ideas enter a *staging environment*.
- Contradictions are detected, logged, and metabolized.
- Only validated evolutions are committed into immutable *versions*.
- Structural validation scripts continuously monitor boundary integrity.

**Mutation is allowed. Corruption is not.**

## Folder Overview

| Folder | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `/content/versions/` | Immutable version history of finalized traces |
| `/content/staging/` | In-progress drafts and pending contradictions |
| `/content/audit_logs/` | Breach detection and audit reports |
| `/content/raw_inputs/` | Incoming, unreviewed proposals |
| `/content/specs/` | Documentation, protocols, and methodology |
| `/content/conflict_maps/` | Contradiction libraries and pressure logs |
| `/engine/` | Core symbolic engine (FSM, dialectical parsers) |
| `/scripts/` | CLI automation tools for validation and mutation |

## Core Engineering Principles

- **Traceability** — Every transformation is recorded, compared, and versioned
- **Falsifiability** — Contradictions are not errors; they are signals
- **Structural Integrity** — Strict separation of raw, staged, and validated domains
- **Controlled Drift** — Evolution is encouraged, but auditable

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# Scan incoming ideas
./scripts/scan_unencoded_artifacts.sh

# Encode an idea under contradiction pressure
./scripts/encode_artifact.sh <artifact_name>

# Track system metabolism and entropy shifts
./scripts/generate_entropy_trace.sh <role> <generation>

# Validate full system integrity
./scripts/validate_topography.sh --strict
```

See `/content/specs/USAGE.md` for full command reference.
